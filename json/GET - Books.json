        "description": "By employing the DMC method, we investigate the performance of eight DFT exchange-correlation functionals for the ground and excited states of some rare-earths. The functionals to which we investigate are CAM-B3LYP, PBELYP, B3PW91, PBEOP, BMK, M06-2X, M06-L, and M06-HF. The present study shows that M06-2X functional with a large fraction of HF exchange is more preferable than M06 for lanthanides; however, the same is not true for actinides. On the other hand, the full HF exchange functional, M06-HF, is not recommended for both lanthanides and actinides. Furthermore, the calculations find that BMK is the best performers for both the ground and excited states of actinides. Our results also suggest not using functionals containing LYP correlation for systems involving lanthanides. Keywords: Diffusion Monte Carlo; Density functional theory; Lanthanides; Actinides.

        "description": "Determining efficient solutions for large scale transportation problems is an important task in operations research. In this paper a transportation algorithm is applied to determine the minimum cost. The algorithm determines the initial Basic Feasible Solution of Transportation problems to minimize the cost. Numerical example are provided to illustrate the proposed algorithm. It can be seen that the proposed algorithm gives a better solution to the given transportation problem. At first the Decision Making Indicators (DMI) are calculated from the difference of the greatest unit cost and the nearest-to-the-greatest unit cost. The least entry of the DMI along the highest DMI is taken as the basic cell. Finally, loads have been imposed on the original TT corresponding to the basic cells of the DMI. Herein the cost minimizing least entries (CMLE) table called Cost Minimizing Small Table (CMST) is formed. So CPU time will become small. Also it discussed how to satisfying the supply and demand restrictions, minimize the total transportation cost. Keywords: IBFS, TT, DMI, CMST.

        "description": "Natural radionuclides, such as, Uranium (U-238), Thorium (Th-236), Radium (Ra-226) and Potassium (K-40) are present in the soil. In this study the detection of natural radioactive materials in the soil of bauxite mining areas in Kuantan was determined. Soil samples were collected from three different places. Advanced Nuclear Spectroscopy System with UCS 30 Universal Computer Spectrometer Software and High Sensitivity Gamma Spectroscopy Model SE-9764 with WinDas Software were used. Background radiation energy spectra and soil samples were obtained and compared. The spectra obtained by measuring all samples show the similar pattern as recorded from the background radiation measurement. Therefore, this study evidenced the absence of radioactive elements in the collected soil samples of bauxite mining areas. However, results cannot be generalized for all bauxite mining areas of Kuantan district. Keywords: Natural radioactivity, Bauxite, Gamma spectroscopy, Soil.

        "description": "The aim of this study was to synthesize silver nanoparticle from the crude extracts of Brucea antidysenterica leaves in order to find possible sources for future novel antibacterial activity in pharmaceutical formulations. Silver nanoparticles were prepared by chemical reduction method and it was confirmed with the help of UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and compared its antibacterial activity with 80%methanol crude extract. The synthesis of nanoparticles was confirmed by change in colour from yellowish to dark brown. Further, it was confirmed by UV-Vis spectrometer which the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles. The peak is clearly visible around 438 nm which indicate the reduction of silver ions occurred due to the water-soluble phytochemicals present in the leaf extract. The synthesized silver nanoparticles have strong antibacterial activity against E.coli and S.aureus than standard and 80%methanol extract. A very low concentration of silver nanoparticle (0.008mg/mL) gave antibacterial performance. Applications of Ag nanoparticle based on these finding may lead to valuable discoveries in various fields such as medical devices and antimicrobial systems. Leaf of Brucea antidysenterica can be used as source of silver nanoparticle to prevent diseases associated with antibacterial activity.

        "description": "The distributed nature of the Web, as a decentralized system exchanging information between heterogeneous sources, has underlined the need to manage interoperability, i.e., the ability to automatically interpret information in Web documents exchanged between different sources, necessary for efficient information management and search applications. In this context, XML was introduced as a data representation standard that simplifies the tasks of interoperation and integration among heterogeneous data sources, allowing to represent data in (semi-) structured documents consisting of hierarchically nested elements and atomic attributes. However, while XML was shown most effective in exchanging data, i.e., in syntactic interoperability, it has been proven limited when it comes to handling semantics, i.e.,  semantic interoperability, since it only specifies the syntactic and structural properties of the data without any further semantic meaning. As a result, XML semantic-aware processing has become a motivating challenge in Web data management, requiring dedicated semantic analysis and disambiguation methods to assign well-defined meaning to XML elements and attributes. In this context, most existing approaches: (i) ignore the problem of identifying ambiguous XML elements/nodes, (ii) only partially consider their structural relationships/context, (iii) use syntactic information in processing XML data regardless of the semantics involved, and (iv) are static in adopting fixed disambiguation constraints thus limiting user involvement. In this paper, we provide a new XML Semantic Disambiguation Framework titled XSDFdesigned to address each of the above limitations, taking as input: an XML document, and then producing as output a semantically augmented XML tree made of unambiguous semantic concepts extracted from a reference machine-readable semantic network. XSDF consists of four main modules for: (i) linguistic pre-processing of simple/compound XML node labels and values, (ii) selecting ambiguous XML nodes as targets for disambiguation, (iii) representing target nodes as special sphere neighborhood vectors including all XML structural relationships within a (user-chosen) range, and (iv) running context vectors through a hybrid disambiguation process, combining two approaches: concept-basedand context-based disambiguation, allowing the user to tune disambiguation parameters following her needs. Conducted experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in comparison with alternative methods. We also discuss some practical applications of our method, ranging over semantic-aware query rewriting, semantic document clustering and classification, Mobile and Web services search and discovery, as well as blog analysis and event detection in social networks and tweets\r\n",

Krisis ekonomi menyebabkan penurunan skala produksi industri kimia sehingga produktivitas pekerja juga ikut mengalami penurunan. Penurunan produktivtas pekerja menjadi alasan bagi pengusaha untuk menurunkan upah pekerja. Di sisi lain krisis ekonomi juga menyebabkan penurunan upah riil pekerja akibat tingginya inflasi. Pekerja berupaya menuntut kenaikan  upah nominal agar kesejahteraannya tidak mengalami penurunan. Tuntutan ini menyebabkan terjadinya permasalahan dalam penentuan upah nominal. Penelitian ini menggunakan data sekunder dari BPS, dan Kementerian Tenaga Kerja dan Transmigrasi. Data sekunder ini dilengkapi dengan data primer. Penelitian ini menggunakan alat analisis regresi berdasar model data panel dinamis. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa penurunan produktivitas pekerja pada industri kimia tidak diikuti dengan penurunan upah nominal. Selama masa krisis, tingkat upah nominal pada industri kimia tidak mengalami penurunan. Pengusaha menyadari bahwa penurunan upah nominal akan berdampak negatif pada kinerja perusahaan.\r\n",
