        "description": "The use of Phase Change Materials as latent heat storage medium is an effective way of storing thermal energy. PCMs offer the advantages of having high energy storage density and its isothermal nature. PCMs have been widely used in latent heat thermal storage systems for heat pumps, solar systems and spacecraft applications. This Study is undertaken to investigate about the effectiveness of heat transfer using PCMs through storing solar energy for domestic water heating. The experimental setup consist of simultaneous functioning heat absorbing units. One is a solar water heater and the other is a heat storage unit consisting of phase change materials. The storage unit stores heat in PCM during the day and supplies hot water during night hours. This storage unit utilizes thermal storage tank filled with industrial granulated paraffin wax (PCMs) as the heat storage medium integrated with the solar collector to absorb energy. The setup compares the difference in the efficiency of the storage system without using PCMs and using PCMs and thereafter the graphical study of the entire setup is conducted.",

        "description": "Construction equipment is a high cost of capital investment necessary for the successful existence of a private construction company .The highest impact cost factor other than the initial purchase investment is the expenses related to maintenance and repair. As the equipment ages, the ownership costs decrease and the operating expenses increase as the maintenance and repairs requirements grow. Both private and public entities desire to manage this high investment for optimization of a perceived profit. This project recommends a decision support model that can be used by private and public entities alike to determine the best fit acquisition method and guidance for profitability optimization. Methods of life cycle cost estimating and decision methods were researched and compared. Data was acquired from equipment rental companies and private construction companies. This data was analyzed to select the appropriate decision factors and develop the Decision Model. Keywords: Construction equipment, acquisition, equipment management.

        "description": "Cyclic loading in marine clay may lead to gradual loss of its shear strength and it is a major cause for increasing pore water pressure. This paper presents the strain-controlled cyclic direct simple shear test results to describe the cyclic undrained shear strength of Malaysia marine clay under different over consolidation ratios (OCR) and strain amplitudes ranging from ±1% to ±5%. It is reported herein that the degradation of shear strength and pore water pressure increment are significant when cyclic strain amplitude applied on clay specimen increases. On the other hand, over consolidated clay specimens tend to develop negative pore pressure at low strain level (±1%) as soon as cyclic tests began. However, normally consolidated clay specimens generate positive pore pressure at all strain amplitudes applied in the present study. Keywords: Clay, strain-controlled, strain amplitudes, pore pressure, simple shear, over consolidation ratio.

        "description": "Slope stabilizing pile is one of the most effective ways to reinforce a slope with soil arching effect, in which the interslice forces transmitted to the soil slice behind the piles is reduced. Limit equilibrium based slope stability analysis technique is used in this paper to ascertain factor of safety of slope as well as to quantify forces within the piles. Load transfer factor has been used to estimate net force imparted on the piles with respect to influencing factors such as spacing and pile properties, slope geometry, soil-strength parameters and pile location on the slope. The present study includes analysis of slope with and without piles to verify the results based on this approach to those proposed by other researchers.

        "description": "Determining efficient solutions for large scale transportation problems is an important task in operations research. In this paper a transportation algorithm is applied to determine the minimum cost. The algorithm determines the initial Basic Feasible Solution of Transportation problems to minimize the cost. Numerical example are provided to illustrate the proposed algorithm. It can be seen that the proposed algorithm gives a better solution to the given transportation problem. At first the Decision Making Indicators (DMI) are calculated from the difference of the greatest unit cost and the nearest-to-the-greatest unit cost. The least entry of the DMI along the highest DMI is taken as the basic cell. Finally, loads have been imposed on the original TT corresponding to the basic cells of the DMI. Herein the cost minimizing least entries (CMLE) table called Cost Minimizing Small Table (CMST) is formed. So CPU time will become small. Also it discussed how to satisfying the supply and demand restrictions, minimize the total transportation cost. Keywords: IBFS, TT, DMI, CMST.
