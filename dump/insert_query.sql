(NULL, 'Dynamic Path Planning for Mobile Robots with Cellular Learning Automata', 'Judhi Santoso, Bambang Riyanto, Widyawardhana Adiprawita', 'In this paper we propose a new approach to path planning for mobile robots with cellular automata and cellular learning automata. We divide the planning into two stages. In the first stage, global path planning is performed by cellular automata from an initial position to a goal position. In this stage, the minimum distance is computed. To compute the path, we use a particular two-dimensional cellular automata rule. The process of computation is performed using simple arithmetic operations, hence it can be done efficiently. In the second stage, local planning is used to update the global path. This stage is required to adapt to changes in a dynamic environment. This planning is implemented using cellular learning automata to optimize performance by collecting information from the environment. This approach yields a path that stays near to the obstacles and therefore the total time and distance to the goal can be optimized.

(NULL, 'Randomized Symmetric Crypto Spatial Fusion Steganographic System', 'Viswanathan Perumal', 'The image fusion steganographic system embeds encrypted messages in decomposed multimedia carriers using a pseudorandom generator but it fails to evaluate the contents of the cover image. This results in the secret data being embedded in smooth regions, which leads to visible distortion that affects the imperceptibility and confidentiality. To solve this issue, as well as to improve the quality and robustness of the system, the Randomized Symmetric Crypto Spatial Fusion Steganography System is proposed in this study. It comprises three-subsystem bitwise encryption, spatial fusion, and bitwise embedding. First, bitwise encryption encrypts the message using bitwise operation to improve the confidentiality. Then, spatial fusion decomposes and evaluates the region of embedding on the basis of sharp intensity and capacity. This restricts the visibility of distortion and provides a high embedding capacity. Finally, the bitwise embedding system embeds the encrypted message through differencing the pixels in the region by 1, checking even or odd options and not equal to zero constraints. This reduces the modification rate to avoid distortion. The proposed heuristic algorithm is implemented in the blue channel, to which the human visual system is less sensitive. It was tested using standard IST natural images with steganalysis algorithms and resulted in better quality, imperceptibility, embedding capacity and invulnerability to various attacks compared to other steganographic systems.', '', 'http://journals.itb.ac.id/public/site/images/budini/jictra.jpg', 'http://journals.itb.ac.id/index.php/jictra/article/view/413/1182', '2337-5787', 'Journal of ICT Research and Applications', '10', '15-28', '1', '2016', '', '', '1'),
(NULL, 'Voting-based Classification for E-mail Spam Detection', 'Bashar Awad Al-Shboul, Heba Hakh, Hossam Faris, Ibrahim Aljarah, Hamad Alsawalqah
', 'The problem of spam e-mail has gained a tremendous amount of attention. Although entities tend to use e-mail spam filter applications to filter out received spam e-mails, marketing companies still tend to send unsolicited e-mails in bulk and users still receive a reasonable amount of spam e-mail despite those filtering applications. This work proposes a new method for classifying e-mails into spam and non-spam. First, several e-mail content features are extracted and then those features are used for classifying each e-mail individually. The classification results of three different classifiers (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forests and k-Nearest Neighbor) are combined in various voting schemes (i.e. majority vote, average probability, product of probabilities, minimum probability and maximum probability) for making the final decision. To validate our method, two different spam e-mail collections were used.', '', 'http://journals.itb.ac.id/public/site/images/budini/jictra.jpg', 'http://journals.itb.ac.id/index.php/jictra/article/view/1795/1184', '2337-5787', 'Journal of ICT Research and Applications', '10', '29-42', '1', '2016', '', '', '1'),

', 'In this research, a triple-band bandpass filter (BPF) using a cascade tri section step impedance resonator (TSSIR), which can be operated at 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, and 2,600 MHz simultaneously, was designed, fabricated and evaluated. Advanced Design System (ADS) was used to design and simulate the proposed BPF. The proposed BPF using cascade TSSIR was fabricated on an FR4 substrate with dielectric permittivity, substrate thickness and loss tangent at 4.3, 1.6 mm and 0.0017, respectively. The performance parameters of the proposed BPF were characterized by insertion loss, return loss, voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) and group delay. The performance results from the simulation were compared to those of the fabricated BPF. The results showed that the performances from both the simulated and the fabricated BPF satisfied the design specifications and were in close agreement with each other. Furthermore, the results indicated that the proposed BPF using cascade TSSIR performed better than a hairpin BPF with TSSIR.', '', 'http://journals.itb.ac.id/public/site/images/budini/jictra.jpg', 'http://journals.itb.ac.id/index.php/jictra/article/view/1304/1180', '2337-5787', 'Journal of ICT Research and Applications', '10', '43-56', '1', '2016', '', '', '1'),

One of the most popular error correction methods in decoding is the Viterbi algorithm. It is extensively implemented in many digital communication applications. Its VLSI design challenges are about area, speed, power, complexity and configurability. In this research, we specifically propose a VLSI architecture for a configurable and low-complexity design of a hard-decision Viterbi decoding algorithm. The configurable and low-complexity design is achieved by designing a generic VLSI architecture, optimizing each processing element (PE) at the logical operation level and designing a conditional adapter. The proposed design can be configured for any predefined number of trace-backs, only by changing the trace-back parameter value. Its computational process only needs N + 2 clock cycles latency, with N is the number of trace-backs. Its configurability function has been proven for N = 8, N = 16, N = 32 and N = 64. Furthermore, the proposed design was synthesized and evaluated in Xilinx and Altera FPGA target boards for area consumption and speed performance.', '', 'http://journals.itb.ac.id/public/site/images/budini/jictra.jpg', 'http://journals.itb.ac.id/index.php/jictra/article/view/1351/1183', '2337-5787', 'Journal of ICT Research and Applications', '10', '57-75', '1', '2016', '', '', '1'),
